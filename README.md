Jenkins LSST Stack Demo
=======================

Synopsis
---

This is a demonstration of deploying a complete
[`jenkins`](https://jenkins-ci.org/) master + build slaves environment to
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) EC2 which is pre-configured to build the LSST
Stack.  The principle goal is to demonstrate a possible migration path away
from LSST DM's existing CI infrastructure.  The key feature improvements over
the existing [`buildbot`](http://buildbot.net/) driven system are:

* concurrently running a build on multiple operating systems
* multiple independent builds of the same job occurring in parallel

A secondary objective is provide an example of deploying a moderately complex
application onto a modern cloud infrastructure.

High level architecture
---

![AWS VPC diagram](./docs/aws_vpc.png)

The instances running the jenkins master and slave processes are deployed into
an AWS "Virtual Private Cloud" or [VPC](https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/).  Using a
non-default VPC (historically, AWS had separate classic and VPC environments;
all newly created AWS accounts have a default VPC in each region that more or
less emulates the "classic" behavior) allows for direct control over the
RFC1918 private address space.  A benefit of this is that the master instance
can have a fixed IP address which the slaves can locate by convention instead
of requiring either the address to be injected or use of a service discovery
mechanism.

Tooling
---

### `packer`

The Centos project supplies "official" `x86_64 HVM` Amazon Machine Images
(AMIs) for both Centos 6 and 7 in all EC2 regions.  However, the images are
slightly out of date, 6.5 vs. 6.7 and 7.0 vs. 7.1, and the Centos 6 image does
not include [`cloud-init`](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) or is
it compatible with vagrant.  The popular
[`chef/bento`](https://github.com/chef/bento) [`packer`](https://packer.io/)
templates were modified to install/configure `cloud-init` for Centos 6, update
the images to the current minor releases, and make both images more friendly
for usage with vagrant.

### `terraform`

As with any network environment, a VPC requires a fair amount of configuration.
Instead of requiring manual interaction via the AWS console,
[`terraform`](https://www.terraform.io/) is used to configure fully configure
the VPC.  Note that terraform has the capability to spawn EC2 instances and
could completely replace vagrant at the expense of loosing a convenient
development/debugging mechanism.

The terraform configuration files are under the ['terraform'](./terraform)
directory.

### `vagrant`

EC2 instances are created/destroyed via
[`vagrant`](https://www.vagrantup.com/).  Vagrant is also used to pass "User
Data" to cloud-init and to run puppet on each node in "masterless" mode.

Vagrant is configured via the ['Vagrantfile'](./Vagrantfile).

### `cloud-init`

There are a number of low-level configurations needed in a cloud environment.
Including:

  * ssh key injection / sudo management
  * dynamic resizing of the instance's block storage
  * hostname/host file management

[`cloud-init`](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) is relied upon to
provide those functions in demo.

### `puppet`

The bulk of the "heavy lifting" (configuring the instances) in this demo is
done by a composition of [`puppet`](https://puppetlabs.com/) modules.   This is
implemented via a bundled "site" module that implements the [Roles and
Profiles](http://www.craigdunn.org/2012/05/239/) pattern.

  * The puppet modules in use are listed in the [Puppetfile](./Puppetfile).
  * The site module is under the [`jenkins_demo`](./jenkins_demo) directory.

### metric collection

A full production deployment would likely involve additional jenkins plugins
for metric collection and instance level metrics collected external to jenkins
which are then made available to end users via a web interface.

#### `ganglia`

The [`ganglia`](http://ganglia.info/) monitoring system is used to collect
general host metrics from the build slaves and are accessible from the web
interface as https://<jenkins-master>/ganglia/.

A possible improvement would be to create `gmetric` values from jenkins when
certain events occur, such as the start and finish of jobs.

#### AWS cloud watch

The demo enables cloud watch metric collection about the instances which is
completely external to jenkins and not visible without AWS account credentials.

### backups

A simple backup solution is provided via a jenkins job named
`jenkins-ec2-snapshot` that will create EBS snapshots of the jenkins-master
using the [`ec-snapshot`](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/ec2-snapshot) script.

_Note that this requires valid AWS credientials to be present in
`common.yaml`_.

Notable omissions
---

### jenkins security

_jenkins does not have any access control enabled.  This means that *anyone*
can change anything, include the jenkins configuration, essentially allowing
arbitrary code to be executed under the jenkins role account._

There is on going development to improve the
[`rtyle/jenkins`](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/rtyler/jenkins) puppet module so
that is can handle the complete set of security configuration needed for a
production deployment without requiring manual configuration by the
administrator.

### DNS

The demo attaches an elastic IP address (public IP) but does not manage DNS
configuration for this address.  There are a number of ways of automatically
handling this including via the terraform AWS provider.

### jenkins plugins

There are a number of plugins that are not configured via this demo as it would
require exposing secrets. This includes github oauth integration and email
notifications.


Prerequisites
-------------

* Vagrant 1.7.x
* `git` - needed to clone this repo

Only needed to use `hiera-eyaml` to decrypt/edit `common.eyaml`

* ruby 1.9.3+
* bundler


Vagrant plugins
---------------

These are required:

* vagrant-puppet-install
* vagrant-librarian-puppet '~> 0.9.0'
* vagrant-aws '~> 0.7.0'

Setup and Deployment
--------------------

### Build updated and vagrant friendly AMIs

#### Download & prepare packer

    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<...>
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<...>
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

    git clone -b builder/aws https://github.com/jhoblitt/bento.git
    cd bento
    mkdir bin
    cd bin
    wget https://dl.bintray.com/mitchellh/packer/packer_0.8.6_linux_amd64.zip
    unzip packer_0.8.6_linux_amd64.zip
    cd ..

#### Select Official Centos AMI to use as base image

EC2 AMI IDs are per region so you need to select the correct AMI ID for the
region in which you plan to build.  _Note that it is possible to copy AMIs
between EC2 regions after they are built.  However, each region will still have
a unique AMI ID_

```
Build 'amazon-ebs' finished.

==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:
--> amazon-ebs: AMIs were created:

us-east-1: ami-67e28202
--> amazon-ebs: 'aws' provider box: builds/__unset_box_basename__.aws.box
```

```
Build 'amazon-ebs' finished.

==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:
--> amazon-ebs: AMIs were created:

us-east-1: ami-ffe3839a
--> amazon-ebs: 'aws' provider box: builds/__unset_box_basename__.aws.box
```

### Declare new AMI IDs

To be used by vagrant.

    export CENTOS6_AMI=ami-67e28202
    export CENTOS7_AMI=ami-ffe3839a
    export MASTER_AMI=$CENTOS7_AMI
    cd ..

### Clone & prepare demo

    git clone git@github.com:jhoblitt/sandbox-jenkins-demo.git
    cd sandbox-jenkins-demo

#### Edit hiera data as necessary

This demo uses a simple [`hiera`](http://docs.puppetlabs.com/hiera/)
configuration for providing configuration data to the puppet manifests used to
provision the nodes. The literal configuration file used by hiera/puppet, if
present, is `hieradata/common.yaml`.

However, some configuration data, such as the hipchat API token, must be kept
confidential.  A rubygem named
[`hiera-eyaml`](https://github.com/TomPoulton/hiera-eyaml) is used to maintain
a "shadow" hiera configuration
[`hieradata/common.eyaml`](hieradata/common.eyaml) that contains mixed
plaintext and encrypted values.  Confidential data that is specific to LSST/DM
is present in this file and the correct private key ring needs to be present
under the `./keys/` directory in order to decrypt it.

    keys/
    ├── private_key.pkcs7.pem
    └── public_key.pkcs7.pem

```shell
$ rsync -av /<path to keys>/keys/ keys/
sending incremental file list
created directory keys
./
private_key.pkcs7.pem
public_key.pkcs7.pem

sent 2,949 bytes  received 84 bytes  6,066.00 bytes/sec
total size is 2,725  speedup is 0.90
```

If you do not have access to LSST/DM keys, you can either copy `common.yaml` to
`common.eyaml` and manually edit it or generate a new `eyaml` key set to
maintain your own version of `common.eyaml` (the LSST/DM encrypted values would
need to be removed).

*It is essential that the eyaml keys are kept confidential and not published in
this repository.*

##### `eyaml` setup

A [Gemfile] is provided to install `hiera-eyaml`.  A working ruby + bundler
install is assumed.

    bundle install

##### provided rake convenience tasks

    bundle exec rake -T

    rake createkeys  # generate new eyaml keys
    rake decrypt     # decrypt common.eyaml -> common.yaml
    rake edit        # edit common.eyaml (requires keys)

##### decrypt `common.eyaml`

    bundle exec rake decrypt

#### Generate ssh key pair

The ssh key pair is required for both terraform and vagrant.

    (cd jenkins_demo/templates; make)

### Run terraform to configure AWS VPC

    cd terraform
    make

    export TF_VAR_aws_access_key=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    export TF_VAR_aws_secret_key=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    export TF_VAR_aws_default_region=$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION
    export TF_VAR_demo_name=${USER}-demo

    # sanity check
    ./bin/terraform plan

    ./bin/terraform apply
    cd ..

### Create AWS EC2 instances with vagrant

#### Install required vagrant plugins

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-puppet-install
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-librarian-puppet --plugin-version '~> 0.9.0'
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-aws --plugin-version '~> 0.6.0'

    # sanity check
    vagrant plugin list

#### Disable parallel actions

One of the vagrant plugins currently in use [sadly] is not compatible with
vagrant parallel providers.  That means vagrant is unable to create EC2
instances in parallel.

    export VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER='aws'
    export VAGRANT_NO_PARALLEL='yes'

#### create pre-provisoined base images

Start up the build slaves first so there isn't state created by the master
attempting to create jobs.

    vagrant up el6-1 el7-1

    # sanity check
    vagrant provision el6-1 el7-1

    vagrant package el6-1
    rm package.box
    vagrant package el7-1
    rm package.box

    vagrant destroy -f el6-1 el7-1

    vagrant up master

    # sanity check
    vagrant provision master

    vagrant package master
    rm package.box

    vagrant destroy -f master

    # sanity check
    vagrant check

```
$ vagrant package el6-1
==> el6-1: Burning instance i-bc806b6f into an ami
==> el6-1: Waiting for the AMI 'ami-ff18e494' to burn...
==> el6-1: Burn was successful in 60s
==> el6-1: Compressing package to: /home/jhoblitt/tmp/sandbox-jenkins-demo/package.box
$ rm package.box
$ vagrant package el7-1
==> el7-1: Burning instance i-a4ef0477 into an ami
==> el7-1: Waiting for the AMI 'ami-0515e96e' to burn...
==> el7-1: Burn was successful in 146s
==> el7-1: Compressing package to: /home/jhoblitt/tmp/sandbox-jenkins-demo/package.box
$ rm package.box
$ vagrant destroy -f el6-1 el7-1
==> el7-1: Terminating the instance...
==> el7-1: Running cleanup tasks for 'puppet' provisioner...
==> el6-1: Terminating the instance...
==> el6-1: Running cleanup tasks for 'puppet' provisioner...
$ vagrant package master
==> master: Burning instance i-7c0de6af into an ami
==> master: Waiting for the AMI 'ami-d312eeb8' to burn...
==> master: Burn was successful in 417s
==> master: Compressing package to: /home/jhoblitt/tmp/sandbox-jenkins-demo/package.box
$ rm package.box
$     vagrant destroy -f master
==> master: Terminating the instance...
==> master: Running cleanup tasks for 'puppet' provisioner...
```

#### Declare new AMI IDs

    export CENTOS6_AMI=ami-ff18e494
    export CENTOS7_AMI=ami-0515e96e
    export MASTER_AMI=ami-d312eeb8

### Save env vars

The shell snippet below will store all of the important environment variables
that have been set into a script called `creds.sh`, intended to be sourced
before performing vagrant/terraform operations in a clean shell.

    cat > creds.sh <<END
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION

    export CENTOS6_AMI=$CENTOS6_AMI
    export CENTOS7_AMI=$CENTOS7_AMI
    export MASTER_AMI=$MASTER_AMI

    export VAGRANT_DEFAULT_PROVIDER='aws'
    export VAGRANT_NO_PARALLEL='yes'

    export TF_VAR_aws_access_key=$TF_VAR_aws_access_key
    export TF_VAR_aws_secret_key=$TF_VAR_aws_secret_key
    export TF_VAR_aws_default_region=$TF_VAR_aws_default_region
    export TF_VAR_demo_name=$TF_VAR_demo_name
    END

### Start all demo instances

    . ./creds.sh
    vagrant up
